# About Me

Hi there! I'm Karl, a high school student in 11th grade based in Berlin, Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.

I'm passionate about Hardware, Coding, Robotics, Cars and want to become an Electrical Engineer later.

## My Background

I've been lightly dabbling in many different programing languages (Python, C#, JavaScript, Java, Rust) and also have designed some robots and thingies in Fusion 360. I primarly care about hardware.
